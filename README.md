# Data Analysis and Feature Engineering on Insurance Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on **data
preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization** using the
popular **Insurance dataset**.\
It is part of my **college coursework** to practice data analysis with
Python.
